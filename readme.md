Traditional text tools can get in the way when your goal is noteatking and comprehension:
- **Word processors**: Overloaded with distracting features and hidden formatting characters
- **Code editors**: Overkill for non-coding text workflows, context menus popping up that you don't want or need

Colorpad strips away complexity, giving you a fast, intuitive space to:
- Dump, highlight, and organize text
- Mentally categorize and process information
- Create an instant filing system with color-coded highlights
- export your structured highlighted information ready to paste directly into an LLM prompt

Colorpad is the perfect tool for:
- Notetaking
- Quickly organizing and categorizing new information
- providing examples from source material to LLMs in many less back and forth steps
- Transcribing with live editing (coming soon)
